                <div><p> My name is Jack Sangl. I am a Computer Engineering student at <a href = "https://www.psu.edu/">Penn State University</a> and am aspiring work in tech. 
                    I am passionate about programming and problem-solving. In 2024 I graduated from <a href = "https://www.fortleboeuf.net/">Fort LeBeouf High School</a> with academic honors. 
                    My journey in technology began with self-driven projects inspired by Harvard’s CS50 course, where I gained foundational programming experience in C. Since then, I’ve expanded my skills and joined my University's Computer Science Club.</p>
                    <p>I have no technincal professional experience but I previously worked at Wegmans Food Markets as a Meat Customer Service Employee. 
                     This role allowed me to develop and refine my communication skills, as I consistently engaged with a diverse range of customers. I learned to adapt my approach to meet their unique needs, ensuring a positive experience and building meaningful connections. 
                     These interpersonal skills will be invaluable as I collaborate with teams and clients in the tech industry.</p>
                    <p>Outside of academics, I am passionate about lifting weights, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, and diving into health and nutrition discussions.
                         I believe that a healthy body fuels a productive mind, and I enjoy sharing this perspective with others.</p>
                    <p> I’m deeply excited about the ever-evolving world of technology and the opportunities it presents to make a meaningful impact. I’m eager to contribute to projects that push boundaries and improve lives through innovation.
