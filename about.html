        <div class="name">About Me</div>
        <div>
            <p> My name is Jack Sangl. I am a Computer Engineering student at <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">Penn State
                    University</a> and am aspiring work in tech.
                I am passionate about programming and problem-solving. In 2024 I graduated from <a
                    href="https://www.fortleboeuf.net/">Fort LeBeouf High School</a> with academic honors.
                My journey in technology began with self-driven projects inspired by Harvard’s CS50 course, where I
                gained foundational programming experience in C. Since then, I’ve expanded my skills and joined my
                University's Computer Science Club.</p>
            <p>I have no technincal professional experience but I previously worked at Wegmans Food Markets as a Meat
                Customer Service Employee.
                This role allowed me to develop and refine my communication skills, as I consistently engaged with a
                diverse range of customers. I learned to adapt my approach to meet their unique needs, ensuring a
                positive experience and building meaningful connections.
                These interpersonal skills will be invaluable as I collaborate with teams and clients in the tech
                industry.</p>
            <p>Outside of academics, I am passionate about lifting weights, experimenting with new recipes in the
                kitchen, and diving into health and nutrition discussions.
                I believe that a healthy body fuels a productive mind, and I enjoy sharing this perspective with others.
            </p>
            <p> I’m deeply excited about the ever-evolving world of technology and the opportunities it presents to make
                a meaningful impact. I’m eager to contribute to projects that push boundaries and improve lives through
                innovation.
